abstract: The topographical heights are required in practice for a number of engineering applications as well as their specific use in many Earth science disciplines. Using a high-resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is the most practical and economical way for obtaining the height data nowadays. These models include errors. So, it is important to clarify the quality as well as the accuracy of the DEM in the study areas before using its data. In general, validating DEMs using independent point-wise data such as GNSS and leveling heights provide an overall accuracy measure in terms of root means square error (r.m.s.e.) of the DEM derived heights. In this study three high-resolution digital elevation models ASTER, SRTM and Turkey Digital Topographic Data (DTED2) in 1 arc-second and 3 arc-second resolutions are assessed using GNSS/leveling data. Using three different sets of GNSS/leveling data invalidations it is aimed to clarify the role of the distribution of the ground-control points as well as the region’s characteristics, such as roughness of topography, land-cover, etc., in the validation results. The conclusions report the accuracy of the validated DEMs in northwest Turkey and hence include a categorization of DEM performances, generated from remotely sensed data and terrestrial techniques, depending on the topographical characteristics. In the test results the accuracies for global DTMs is 8.0 m, and for regional DTED2 DEM is 6.0 m.
